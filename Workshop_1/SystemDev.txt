System Development
Process from Order to Delivery (model waterfall)
waterfall: depend on the process, can not go through or skip the process, one by one
requirement definition, system analysis and design, system development, testing, maintenance and operation

agile model: assign in more small deliver, sprint, iteration interaction, can do at same time
requirement, analysis, testing, development as one segment development process 

RFI: request for information 
vendor giving consultation to client, client will provide the project specification, identify the needs from vendor,

RFP: request for Proposal
identify specific requirements, solution design, 
identify required project, list of proposal description, budgeting

Contract: review proposal and estimate

Flow of Development
Requirement Definition: process involves clarifying the function required for system, made clear
ensure the client mind is aligned with the developers
which business processes need to be systematized
what functionalities are necessary
what performance criteria are required
step:
category functional, non-functional, technical, business,
analysis and evaluation
identify the most impact one, prioritizing
case scenario, used case,
validating

System analysis and Design: translated into specific, actionable details to enable the development process effectively
external design(screen, UI, perspective of the end user), internal design(function design), data design

Development Implementaiton: proceed programming and infrastructure setup according to the speciffication defined
testing: identify defects in developed software and improve those defects to create a better software product.

System Dev Methodologies
waterfall = linear and sequential approach to software dev. each phase must be completed berfore the next phase
advantage = progress management and estimation are easire because each phase must be completed first
disadvantage = significant cost can be incurred if there are changes in requirement or correction needed during process
suitable case = quality must be guaranteed and no failures are acceptable, banking system, stock exchange, telecom system

agile = involve repeateing processes from requirement definition, testing, to operation in small cycles for each feature
adv= flexibly respond to specification changes and closely meet the client request
disadv= schedule management and control are difficult
suitable case = cases where dev priorites may changed based on client business situation, priority or specification may changes

----------------------------
Requirement Definition
purpose= understand overall process and task involced in requirment definition and design phanse system development
obj= able to explain overall process of requirement definition and design phase
	able to independently create deliverables for the requirements defininiton

the process of creating information needed by programmaers to perform programming after receiving customer requirment
requirements definition, external design, internal design => specification document
-allign the understanding between customer and developers => what needs to be done
-decide on specification of the system => what kind of system build
-decide internal specification of system, comunicate to progammaer what kind of system build

organize the customer what they want to do(request/requirement) and align understanding(definition) on what will be achieved(requirement)

work process:

study case
client= railway operating company tokyo 200 stations, number employees 10000
request= large number of lost items are delivered every day, recorded paper list management, tracking the items owner 

1.project policy= communicate to all stakeholders, organize and present background, obj, outcomes, constraint, scope of system emplement
step=
-project background and obj: unfavorable current situation that led to the decision build system, 
obj:goal to achieved through system implementation
{200 station received and hand over large number items, implenting system to manage
-expected outcome= describe benefit in terms cost, speed, work quality, specify required target
{speed up process handling over lost item, reduce rate of lost item misplacement
-project scope= clarify business, operation, departementt, and system scope project, specifying what is not included
{lost items management
-project constraint= contraint factors of time, cost, resource
{system operational end November 2019

2.review current operation= create a business workflow diagram, overall flow of business is visible, 
digramming and visually analyzing business process
steps:
-identify target business process= start with high level business processes then break them down into more detailed task
{lost item management => - lost item handling, - lost item hand over
-identify participant each phase
{lost item handling: who lost, who found, station staff, lost item handover: who lost, station staff
-identify task for each participant= do not place process in parallel, standard flowchat, indicate where document and system utilized
-identify 

3. issue= hinder the project objective and determine the problem that need to be addressed
steps;
-collect issue through survey= use standardized survey form high quality response
-organize issue through interview= clarify ambiguous, verify causal relationship, exlude problem outside scope
-evaluate the problem, determine issue= avoid solve all issue at once, evaluate based on criteria importance, urgency, diffulty

4. solution for issue
step:
-draft initial solution= do not consider solution solely based on system mechanism, business, content, policies, environtment
-review and decide= ensure customer agreement based on the policies, rules, organization structure

5. new business workflow= review updated business process incorporating the solution to the issue, future businees workflow digarm
step:
-identify the target business= ensure business flow include all the solution issue
-identify 

6. funtional requirement= feature specific operation related to the database, 
identify list funtion required for the system to fulfill future business 
	identify necessary funtion for system, specific operation on specific type of data
	verify identified function can be execute 

7. Non functional requirement= feature that not really connected to the business directly, compatibility, portability, security
define non functional requirement
step
-collect user requirement= conduct interview based on criteria
-asses the immprtance requirement= all individual opinion are adopted, may lead to unnecessary requirement
-determine non functional requiremend to address important needs= 

8. execution plan= creat project execution plan to implement defined requirement, schedule,
step
-define development process= detailed task item and schedule each phase
-determine schedule= make gantchart
-establish project plan
-define the deliverable
