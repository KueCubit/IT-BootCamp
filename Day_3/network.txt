network
metode untuk menghubungkan perangkat computer Bersama
method to connecting multiple PC together
several pc in organization connect with each other in network to internal server, and have 1 router to connect it to internet, same principle with our own devices, connect to our router or wifi to the network or Internet
it is using LAN network, NET connect several LAN together to communicate between each

protocol (network coms standard)
standard comuication network, manage how device connect with each other, foundation of network
define as standard for network and the device connected to communicate with each other
rules data format, how data is sent, how data is received. 
7th layer -> OSI basic reference model (open system interconnection)

transport network
datalink physical

physical layer : convert electrical signal, ethernet, fiber optic, repeaters
data link: control data transmission, ethernet, IEE 802.11, Token RIng, PPP, bridges, switches
network: enable connection between different LAN, IP, router
transport: ensure data sent from source arrive correctly to destination, TCP,UDP
TCP: connection oriented, reliability high, transfer speed slow, web browsing, file transfer, 
UDP: connection less, low, fast, dns, ntp, dhcp, snmp, voice call, video streaming, 
session: manage session virtual connection and provide synchronization for send/receive data, maintain it can be continued
presentation: define data representing format, distinguishing between data, specifies data representation format, include encryption, compression, character encoding
application: provide communication between server programs and user application, ssh, http, smtp, pop

ssh : protocol for communicating with remote computer, 22ca
http: protocol used for transferring web pages on the WWW, 80,443
smtp: protocol responsible for e-mail, manage between mail server, 25

osi: designe to address necessary functions for coms protocol
tcp/ip: framework design to address how to implement communication protocol in computer
application, transport, internet, network interface
application layer: protocol for interaction with application, web browser, email
transport layer: ensuring reliability in communication, break into small segment, 
internet : communication with intended recipient, manage the package to the destination, break into small part again
Network interface: communicationg with nearest device, can transmission with cable to output, switch, router

IP
carrying packets from one network to another to deliver to the recipient, routing
IP address: as an address wthin the network, similar to postal address
TCP
established a connection with communication partner before transmitting data, ensuing reliable and ordered data transfer

IP address
each device connected to the network is assigne a unique number for management, identify device
represented as 32-bit number into 8-bit segment

global ip address: identify device in internet for global
private ip address: identify device in LAN network

subnet mask: specifies which part of the IP address is the network addresss
1: indicate the network address portion
0: indicate host address portion
 
network address: identifier for host on a telecommunications network
AND operation: ipaddress and subnet mask

broadcast address: address that reaches all device connected to the network, communicate with all device

IP address class
define the class based on scale, A,B,C
each class specifies how many bits out of 32 bit address are allocated to network add0ress, effect number of host

DHCP
process of assigning IP address and configuring network setting automated, dns address, gateway
leased period, can be renew automatically when the leased period terminated

static IP: unchanged unless deliberately modified, network administrator
dynamic IP: assigne automatically and change over time. (leased period), network administrator

a dynamically assigne IP address usually works fine, can be more secure less likely to be targeted by attack.
for device like printer, it is more practical using static ip.

localhost: hostname that points to oneself, accessing server in our computer
independent of external network settings, can be used even not connected to network
