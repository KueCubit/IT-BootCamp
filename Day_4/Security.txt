Security
protecting data, system, and communication pathways=>when accessing from browser to server, it needs protection
eliminate risk of confidentiality leaks, external attacks, tampering

Unauthorized Access, authentic user, data integrity, audit
user authorized: process of verifying whether a user trying to access
unauthorized individual accessing third party information or server without permission
	password list attack(data breach, bruteforce with another credential), sql injection, cross-site scripting (inject script)
measure:
user: avoid reusing same password across multiple accounts
website: limit IP, reCAPTCHA

sql: attacker intentionally exploits vulnerabilitis in an application security to execute sql statemet that app does not expect, manipulate database server, using OR function
measure:
implement excaping techniques: replacing or removing special character that have special meaning in SQL quaries
web app firewall: security in layer 7th, prevent unauthorized access by monitoring and managing web application

cross-site (xss): insert malicious script into dynamic sites, where end users can create web page themselves
measure: implement escaping, limit input values only allow several , implement WAF

data transmitted over the network is usually in plaintext,

threats
eavesdropping: individual intercepting and vieweing data

tampering: modifying or altering data

spoofing: 3rd party pretending tobe a legitimate entity to conduct transaction or transfer

encryption: transforming data into form that is not understable to 3rd parties, decrption(reverting encrypted data to original form)
symmetric key encryption: use same encryption for the two parties
public key: different pair key for encryp and decrypt, using public key to encrypt, and private key to decrypt
digital signature

sym vs public
same key, different key
each user all keys, only private key
confidentiality essential, encryption can be published
processing high, slow

digital signature: to detect data tampering, using techniques from public key, veriffication digest with signature
data encrypt with private key, can only be decrypted with corresponding public key
data encrypt with public key, can only be decrypted with corresponding private key

digital certificate, SSL server certificate
digital signature can detect tampering of data, however digital signature alone doesnot verify whether public key being used in genuinely correct
issued by CA
verify identity of communication partner by checking 

SSL/TLS
public key, symmetric key, pemrosesannya lebih cepat, 

internet has many user with malicious untent, attack method are varied and so are the ways to defend
as creators, important to acqyure proper knowledge of security measures to ensure that legitimate user can use our service with confidence
information security guidelines by IPA

brute force att
user: use password as long as possible, combined
website: implement system that enforce the creation of such password

rainbow table att: table contain both plaintext passwords and their corresponding hashed values

Hashing: process converting original data into fixed length value that appears random, according to hash algorithm, irreversible transformation

stretching: method involve repeateedly applying the hash function when computing its hash value

Caesar cipher: shift character bu a number specified to produce ciphertext (stream)
block cipher: general term for encryption method that process data in fixed size block
stream cipher: 

rsa encryption
elliptic curve dsa (ecdsa)

process of digital certificates
buy from CA, and apply to the server

DoS att
sending a large volume of data to target site or server, abnormal increase in traffic, causing server or site become overwhelmed and crash or become unavaible

monitoring IP address, restricting access from specific IP address

DDoS att
multiple machine are hijacked using malware, used to launch DoS att, using multiple IP address
WAF, ddos protection tools
